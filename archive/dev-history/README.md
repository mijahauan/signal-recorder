# Development History Archive

This directory contains historical documentation about bugs, fixes, migrations, and development sessions that are now complete.

## Purpose

- Understanding historical design decisions
- Reference for similar future issues
- Project history and documentation

## Contents

### Migration Documentation
Completed migration projects (ka9q-python extraction, data storage reorganization, etc.)

### Session Summaries
