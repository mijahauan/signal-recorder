# hf-timestd Documentation Index

Reading-order map for the `hf-timestd` documentation set. Start at the top and
follow the track that matches your goal. The **canonical** docs (one per domain)
are marked ★ — when two docs disagree, the canonical one wins.

> Scientific and metrology methods cite their sources inline; the consolidated
> bibliography lives in [`publications/QEX_DRAFT.md`](publications/QEX_DRAFT.md)
> (the ARRL QEX article draft), which is the reference of record for the methodology.

## 1. Start here

| Doc | What it gives you |
|-----|-------------------|
| [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md) | The system in one page: what it is, the metrology/physics split, where to go next. |
| [ARCHITECTURE-FIRST-PRINCIPLES.md](ARCHITECTURE-FIRST-PRINCIPLES.md) ★ | The substrate-vs-annotation framing and the producer-side timing-authority (§18) contract surface. Read before changing the timing path. |
| [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) | Formal `HFT-*` requirements, reconciled to the code with status tags. |

## 2. Architecture

| Doc | What it gives you |
|-----|-------------------|
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) ★ | Pipeline + service layering (Recording → Metrology → Fusion → Chrony SHM), the SQLite storage backend, the service/timer inventory. |
| [TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md](TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md) | Channels, data products, config shape, CLI surface. |
| [design/](design/) | Design rationale behind the architecture (see [design/METROLOGY_PHYSICS_SPLIT.md](design/METROLOGY_PHYSICS_SPLIT.md), the authority and measurement-path designs). |

## 3. Metrology & timing

| Doc | What it gives you |
|-----|-------------------|
| [METROLOGY.md](METROLOGY.md) ★ | **The canonical timing reference.** T-tier hierarchy, the §4.5–§4.6 timing-authority invariant, error budget, chrony feeds (FUSE/HPPS), the clock-health watchdog. |
| [design/T6_EDGE_METHODS_COMPARED.md](design/T6_EDGE_METHODS_COMPARED.md) | How wd-record (Newell) and hf-timestd each find the TS-1 PPS edge; pros and cons; five measurements to compare them. Start here to understand T6. |
| [design/T3_FUSION_EXPLAINED.md](design/T3_FUSION_EXPLAINED.md) | How FUSION establishes T3: marker → L1 → L2 → fusion → three sinks; the host-clock loop and its guards. Start here to understand T3. |
| [design/STATION-TIMING-ESTIMATOR.md](design/STATION-TIMING-ESTIMATOR.md) | One estimator on the sample counter: the two states, the refusals in order, the step rule, and what it does not provide. Companion to its design spec [superpowers/specs/2026-09-08-station-timing-estimator-design.md](superpowers/specs/2026-09-08-station-timing-estimator-design.md). Library only — nothing constructs it yet. |
| [TIMING-PIPELINE-WIRING.md](TIMING-PIPELINE-WIRING.md) | Runtime wiring of RTP / chrony / fusion and the SHM producers. |
| [BPSK-PPS-DETECTION-METHODS.md](BPSK-PPS-DETECTION-METHODS.md) | The five BPSK PPS edge-detection methods (HPPS matched-filter; HFPS diff feed wired but disabled by default). |
| [HF-PPS-CHRONY-TUNING.md](HF-PPS-CHRONY-TUNING.md) | Costas + chrony refclock tuning for the BPSK PPS feed. |
| [HDF5-TO-SQLITE-MIGRATION.md](HDF5-TO-SQLITE-MIGRATION.md) | The current storage design (SQLite is the sole backend post-v7.0); cited by `io/sqlite_*`. |

## 4. Physics & ionospheric science

| Doc | What it gives you |
|-----|-------------------|
| [PHYSICS.md](PHYSICS.md) ★ | **The canonical science capability inventory** (✅/⚠️/❌ honesty markers): dTEC, propagation-mode ID, foF2, TID, scintillation. |
| [CARRIER_DOPPLER_INTERPRETATION.md](CARRIER_DOPPLER_INTERPRETATION.md) | Doppler-as-data: carrier-phase dTEC and path-length interpretation. |
| [IONOSPHERIC_REANALYSIS.md](IONOSPHERIC_REANALYSIS.md) | Hourly post-hoc physics filter (foF2/foE MUF validation, mode correction). |
| [IONOSPHERIC_RESOLUTION.md](IONOSPHERIC_RESOLUTION.md) | Error-source hierarchy (ionospheric path delay dominates). |
| [PHARLAP_RAYTRACING.md](PHARLAP_RAYTRACING.md) | PHaRLAP/pyLAP ray tracing (advisory overlay), the `raytrace` CLI, worked examples. |
| [GPS_TEC_OPTIONAL.md](GPS_TEC_OPTIONAL.md) · [ZED_F9P_TEC_CONFIGURATION.md](ZED_F9P_TEC_CONFIGURATION.md) | Optional dual-frequency GNSS TEC validation. |
| [PHASE_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md](PHASE_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md) | ⚠️ **Planned** coherent multi-antenna array — design only; the array DSP is not implemented (channel registry + external phase-engine source selection exist). |

## 5. Data products, upload & integration

| Doc | What it gives you |
|-----|-------------------|
| GRAPE_DAILY_PROCESSING.md → **[hamsci-physics](https://github.com/HamSCI/hamsci-physics/blob/main/docs/GRAPE_DAILY_PROCESSING.md)** | The daily PSWS pipeline moved out in the 2026-08-24 split. |
| [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md) | Client API for wsprdaemon v4 and external consumers (SQLite store, authority snapshot). |
| [external-data-sources.md](external-data-sources.md) | Live external data sources + health-check commands. |
| [HAMSCI_QUALITY_METADATA_PROPOSAL.md](HAMSCI_QUALITY_METADATA_PROPOSAL.md) | Proposed HamSCI quality/uncertainty metadata standard. |
| DRF_UPLOAD_SYSTEM.md → **[hamsci-physics](https://github.com/HamSCI/hamsci-physics/blob/main/docs/DRF_UPLOAD_SYSTEM.md)** | Digital RF output; moved with the GRAPE pipeline. |

## 6. Operations, setup & deployment

| Doc | What it gives you |
|-----|-------------------|
| [DEBUGGING.md](DEBUGGING.md) ★ | Journald-only logging, triage recipes (incl. clock free-run / makestep), deploy footguns. |
| [EXTERNAL_PREREQUISITES.md](EXTERNAL_PREREQUISITES.md) | The six external dependencies and how to stage them. |
| [STATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md](STATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md) · PSWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md and NASA_EARTHDATA_SETUP.md → **[hamsci-physics](https://github.com/HamSCI/hamsci-physics/tree/main/docs)** | First-time site setup here; PSWS upload and NASA Earthdata setup moved with the science products. |
| [PIPELINE_VERIFICATION.md](PIPELINE_VERIFICATION.md) | Pipeline verification procedure. |
| [WWVB-INTEGRATION.md](WWVB-INTEGRATION.md) | WWVB 60 kHz fusion source (Layer 4 — currently gated off, awaiting validation). |
| Web dashboard → **[station-web](https://github.com/mijahauan/station-web)** | The operator web UI left this repo in the 2026-09-06 split (Phase 5). It reads the same `/var/lib/timestd` products; run and document it there. |

*Canonical reference of record for timing: METROLOGY.md §4.5–§4.6. For science: PHYSICS.md.
Both are reconciled against the code; the `HFT-*` requirement IDs in REQUIREMENTS.md trace the claims.*
