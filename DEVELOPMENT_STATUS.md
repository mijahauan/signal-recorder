# Development Status & Roadmap

This document summarizes the current state of the `signal-recorder` project, what has been accomplished, and the plan for completing the implementation.

**Current Date:** October 24, 2025

## Phase 1: Core Implementation (✓ Complete)

We have successfully designed and implemented the core application from the ground up. All foundational Python modules, configuration files, and documentation are in place and have been pushed to your GitHub repository.

| Component | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial Analysis** | ✓ Complete | Analyzed `wsprdaemon` and `ka9q-radio` to define requirements. |
| **Architecture Design** | ✓ Complete | Designed a modular, plugin-based architecture. |
| **Project Scaffolding** | ✓ Complete | Created a standard Python project structure with packaging. |
| **Core Modules** | ✓ Complete | Implemented all primary modules (`discovery`, `recorder`, `storage`, etc.). |
| **CLI Interface** | ✓ Complete | Built a command-line interface with subcommands (`discover`, `daemon`, `process`). |
| **Configuration** | ✓ Complete | Implemented a flexible configuration system using TOML files. |
| **Git Integration** | ✓ Complete | Established a direct workflow using SSH for all code delivery. |

## Phase 2: Integration & Testing (In Progress)

This is the current phase. We are working on integrating the `signal-recorder` with your live `ka9q-radio` instance and debugging the real-world interactions.

| Feature | Status | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stream Discovery** | ✓ **Working** | The `discover` command successfully uses the `control` utility to find all 20 existing channels defined in your `radiod@.conf`. |
| **Channel Creation** | ⚠️ **In Progress** | The `create-channels` command successfully creates a new SSRC in `radiod`. However, it is **failing to set the frequency and preset**, which remain at `0.000 MHz` and `usb` respectively. |
| **Recording** |  untested | The recording module has not been tested with the live system yet. |
| **Processing** | untested | The GRAPE processing pipeline has not been tested. |
| **Uploading** | untested | The upload module has not been tested. |

### Current Blocker: Channel Configuration

The immediate next step is to fix the bug preventing the `create-channels` command from correctly setting the frequency and preset for newly created channels. The issue lies in how we are scripting the interactive `control` utility; it receives the command to create the SSRC but fails to process the subsequent commands to set the parameters.

**Hypothesis:** The `control` utility may require a small delay between commands or a different command sequence than what we are currently sending.

## Phase 3: Roadmap (Next Steps)

Once the channel creation bug is resolved, we will proceed with the following ordered plan to complete the project.

| Step | Action | Objective | Estimated Effort |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Debug Channel Configuration** | Fix the bug in `channel_manager.py` to ensure frequency and preset are set correctly when creating a new channel. | 1-2 hours |
| **2** | **Validate Full Channel Creation** | Run `create-channels --config config/grape-minimal.toml` to create all 9 required GRAPE channels (WWV & CHU) and verify they are configured correctly. | 30 minutes |
| **3** | **Integrate Auto-Creation** | Modify the `daemon` command to automatically run the channel creation logic at startup, making the system fully autonomous. | 1 hour |
| **4** | **Test Recording Pipeline** | Run the `daemon` for a short period (e.g., 15 minutes) to test the end-to-end recording pipeline. Verify that WAV files are created in the correct directories for the correct SSRCs. | 1 hour |
| **5** | **Test Processing Pipeline** | Manually run the `process` command on the recorded data to test the GRAPE processing pipeline. Verify that Digital RF files are created. | 2 hours |
| **6** | **Test Upload Pipeline** | Configure credentials for the HamSCI server and test the `upload` functionality to ensure data is successfully transferred. | 2 hours |
| **7** | **Finalize Documentation** | Update the `README.md` and all documents in the `docs/` directory with final, validated instructions for installation, configuration, and operation. | 2 hours |
| **8** | **Cleanup & Release** | Remove temporary test files, finalize the `grape-minimal.toml` configuration, and create a final release tag in Git. | 1 hour |

By following this structured plan, we can efficiently resolve the current issue and systematically validate each component of the application, ensuring a robust and reliable final product.
