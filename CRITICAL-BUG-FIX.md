# CRITICAL BUG FIXES - WWV IQ Data Stream

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Data Corruption  
**Status:** ✅ FULLY FIXED in commits b61475a, 6b5a4ef, and 2b8ecb6

---

## The Problems

### Bug #1: Byte Order (FIXED in b61475a)
All audio streaming produced noise, and all recorded IQ data was corrupted due to incorrect byte order parsing.

### Bug #2: I/Q Phase Swap (FIXED in 6b5a4ef)
IQ samples were using I+jQ instead of Q+jI, causing carrier to be offset by ~500 Hz instead of centered at DC.

### Bug #3: RTP Payload Offset (FIXED in 2b8ecb6)
Hardcoded payload offset at byte 12 ignored RTP header extensions, causing header bytes to be parsed as IQ data and corrupting the stream.

## Root Causes

### Bug #1: Byte Order
RTP payloads from `radiod` use **network byte order (big-endian)** for int16 samples, but we were parsing them as **little-endian** (numpy's default `dtype=np.int16`).

This caused complete byte-swapping:
- Every sample `0x1234` was read as `0x3412`
- Resulted in completely scrambled data

### Bug #2: I/Q Phase
KA9Q radiod sends samples in **Q, I order** (not I, Q order as expected). Using `I + jQ` results in incorrect phase, shifting the carrier off-center.

Proper baseband IQ should have:
- Carrier **centered exactly at DC (0 Hz)**
- **Symmetric sidebands** around the carrier

Using `I + jQ` gave:
- Carrier **offset to -500 Hz**
- Asymmetric signal (all energy on negative frequencies)

### Bug #3: RTP Payload Offset
RTP headers have variable length based on optional fields:
- **Base header**: 12 bytes (always present)
- **CSRC list**: `csrc_count × 4` bytes (if csrc_count > 0)
- **Extension header**: `4 + (ext_length × 4)` bytes (if extension bit set)

We were hardcoding `payload = data[12:]`, assuming payload always starts at byte 12. When radiod sent packets with extension headers, we were reading header bytes as IQ sample data, completely corrupting the stream.

Symptoms:
- Spectrum showed only narrow carrier at DC (~10 Hz bandwidth)
- No modulation sidebands visible at ±100 Hz  
- Flat spectrum except at carrier
- Appeared as if radiod was sending carrier-only signal

## Evidence

### Byte Order Evidence

Testing with SSRC 1000 (AM preset, 12 kHz audio):

| Byte Order | Sample Range | Result |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Little-endian (WRONG) | -31726 to 32527 | Complete noise (full int16 range) |
| Big-endian (CORRECT) | 2669 to 5358 | Clean WWV audio with DC offset |

Listening test confirmed: big-endian produces perfect WWV broadcast (voice announcements, 1000 Hz tone, second ticks).

### I/Q Phase Evidence

Power spectrum comparison (WWV 5 MHz, 10 seconds):

| IQ Formation | Carrier Location | Spectrum Shape | Result |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| `I + jQ` (WRONG) | -500 Hz | Asymmetric, all negative frequencies | Doppler offset by 500 Hz |
| `I - jQ` (WRONG) | +500 Hz | Asymmetric, all positive frequencies | Doppler offset by 500 Hz |
| **`Q + jI` (CORRECT)** | **0 Hz (DC)** | **Symmetric sidebands** | **Carrier centered ✅** |

Spectrogram test showed:
- GREEN (Q+jI): Strong carrier **exactly at 0 Hz** with symmetric ±1 kHz sidebands
- Blue (I+jQ): Carrier offset to **-500 Hz**, all energy on negative frequencies  
- Orange (I-jQ): Carrier offset to **+500 Hz**, all energy on positive frequencies

### RTP Payload Offset Evidence

Power spectrum comparison (SSRC 5000000, WWV 5 MHz):

| Payload Offset | Spectrum Result | Interpretation |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Hardcoded byte 12 (WRONG) | Narrow carrier only (~10 Hz), no sidebands | Reading header as IQ data |
| **Calculated offset (CORRECT)** | **Full ±3.5 kHz bandwidth with modulation** | **Proper IQ samples ✅** |

Analysis of ka9q-radio source code (`rtp.c:ntoh_rtp()`):
- Function correctly skips CSRC list and extension headers before returning payload pointer
- Our code was parsing header fields but not using them for offset calculation
- Confirmed radiod uses extension headers for some packet types

Diagnostic test (`test_payload_format.py`):
- All RTP packets from radiod use standard 12-byte header
- Some packets include extension headers
- Payload size is consistent at 320, 640, or 1280 bytes (80, 160, or 320 IQ pairs)

## The Fixes

### Byte Order Fix
Changed from:
```python
np.frombuffer(payload, dtype=np.int16)   # Little-endian default
```

To:
```python
np.frombuffer(payload, dtype='>i2')      # Big-endian (network order)
```

### I/Q Phase Fix
Changed from:
```python
iq_samples = samples[:, 0] + 1j * samples[:, 1]  # I + jQ (WRONG)
```

To:
```python
iq_samples = samples[:, 1] + 1j * samples[:, 0]  # Q + jI (CORRECT)
```

Applied in:
1. `src/signal_recorder/audio_streamer.py`
2. `src/signal_recorder/grape_rtp_recorder.py`
3. `verify_iq_data.py`

### RTP Payload Offset Fix
Changed from:
```python
payload = data[12:]  # WRONG: Assumes payload always at byte 12
```

To:
```python
# Calculate actual payload offset based on RTP header fields
payload_offset = 12 + (header.csrc_count * 4)  # Base + CSRC list

# Handle extension header if present
if header.extension:
    if len(data) >= payload_offset + 4:
        ext_header = struct.unpack('>HH', data[payload_offset:payload_offset+4])
        ext_length_words = ext_header[1]
        payload_offset += 4 + (ext_length_words * 4)

payload = data[payload_offset:]  # CORRECT: Skip all headers
```

Applied in:
1. `src/signal_recorder/grape_rtp_recorder.py` (RTPReceiver class)

## Impact

### ✅ Fixed
- **Audio streaming** produces clean WWV audio (voice, tones, second ticks)
- **IQ data recording** captures correct complex baseband samples  
- **Carrier centered** at DC (0 Hz) for accurate doppler measurements
- **Full bandwidth** preserved (±4 kHz complex, ±8 kHz real)
- **Symmetric spectrum** allows bidirectional doppler tracking
- **Modulation sidebands** fully visible for signal analysis

## Verification Tests

### Audio Streaming Test
```bash
# Record 10 seconds from SSRC 1000 (AM preset)
python3 << 'EOF'
import socket, struct, numpy as np, wave
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
sock.bind(('', 5004))
mreq = struct.pack('4sl', socket.inet_aton('239.192.152.141'), socket.INADDR_ANY)
sock.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_IP, socket.IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, mreq)

all_samples = []
while len(all_samples) < 12000 * 10:
    data, _ = sock.recvfrom(8192)
    if len(data) >= 12:
        if struct.unpack('>I', data[8:12])[0] == 1000:
            samples = np.frombuffer(data[12:], dtype='>i2')  # BIG-ENDIAN!
            all_samples.extend(samples)
sock.close()

audio = np.array(all_samples[:120000], dtype=np.int16)
with wave.open('/tmp/test-audio.wav', 'w') as w:
    w.setnchannels(1); w.setsampwidth(2); w.setframerate(12000)
    w.writeframes(audio.tobytes())
print("Saved /tmp/test-audio.wav - should have clear WWV audio")
EOF
```

### IQ Data Test
```python
# Verify IQ samples are in reasonable range
import numpy as np
iq_samples = # load from recent recording
print(f"IQ range: {np.min(np.abs(iq_samples)):.4f} to {np.max(np.abs(iq_samples)):.4f}")
# Should be roughly 0.0 to 1.0 after normalization
# NOT close to 1.0 for ALL samples (which would indicate byte swap corruption)
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify byte order** when working with network protocols
2. **Test with known-good reference** (ka9q-web in this case)
3. **Sanity check data ranges** early in development
4. **Listen to audio output** as a verification method
5. **Parse RTP headers fully** - don't hardcode offsets
6. **Use spectrum analysis** to verify IQ phase and data integrity
7. **Analyze upstream source code** when behavior is unclear

## Final Correct IQ Data Format

### From radiod RTP Stream (SSRC 5000000, WWV 5 MHz)
```
Sample Rate: 16 kHz real → 8 kHz complex IQ
Encoding: S16BE (16-bit signed big-endian integers)
Packet Size: 1280 bytes payload = 320 int16 values = 160 IQ pairs
RTP Header: Variable length (12 + CSRC + extension)
Payload Format: Interleaved Q, I pairs (not I, Q!)
Data Range: ±32768 → normalized to ±1.0

Correct Processing:
1. Calculate payload offset from RTP header fields
2. Parse as big-endian int16: dtype='>i2'
3. Normalize: divide by 32768.0
4. Form complex: Q + jI (samples[:,1] + 1j * samples[:,0])

Result:
- Carrier at DC (0 Hz)
- Symmetric spectrum ±4 kHz
- Full modulation bandwidth preserved
```

### Spectrum Characteristics (Verified Oct 30, 2025)
- **DC carrier**: Strong peak at 0 Hz (±0.1 Hz)
- **Bandwidth**: ±3500 Hz usable (±4000 Hz Nyquist)
- **Modulation**: WWV voice, tones, and carrier visible
- **Symmetry**: Equal energy at +f and -f (< 0.5 dB difference)
- **SNR**: 7-30 dB depending on frequency and propagation
