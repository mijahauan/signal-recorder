## Development Summary and Next Steps

Here is a high-level summary of where we stand with the `signal-recorder` project.

### What's Done (Phase 1 - Complete)

*   **Full Core Implementation:** All the foundational Python code for discovery, recording, processing, and uploading is written and organized into a proper Python package.
*   **Complete Documentation:** We have a full suite of documentation, including a README, a comprehensive deployment guide, and configuration examples.
*   **Git Workflow Established:** We are working directly in your GitHub repository, which streamlines the development process.

### What We're Doing Now (Phase 2 - In Progress)

We are in the critical **integration and testing phase**. The code is complete, but it must be tested against your live `ka9q-radio` system to ensure it works in a real-world environment.

*   **Discovery:** **Working!** We can successfully discover all 20 of your existing channels.
*   **Channel Creation:** **Partially working.** We can successfully create a new channel (SSRC) in `radiod`, but we are currently blocked by a bug that prevents us from setting its frequency and preset correctly.

### The Immediate Blocker

Our top priority is to **fix the channel creation bug**. The `control` utility is not responding to our scripted commands to set the frequency after a channel is created. We need to debug the command sequence being sent to `radiod`.

### The Roadmap (What's Next)

Once we fix the channel creation bug, we will proceed with the following steps:

1.  **Validate Full Channel Creation:** Create all 9 required GRAPE channels at once.
2.  **Integrate Auto-Creation into Daemon:** Make the recording daemon automatically create any missing channels when it starts.
3.  **Test the Full Pipeline:** Systematically test the **recording**, **processing**, and **uploading** modules with live data.
4.  **Finalize and Release:** Update all documentation with validated instructions and finalize the project for production use.

The detailed breakdown of every step is in the `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md` document.
