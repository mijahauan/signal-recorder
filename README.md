**Monitor:** Open `http://localhost:3000` for real-time channel health, quality metrics, and logs.

## Architecture

**Three-service design** built on a **generic recording infrastructure**:

ka9q-radio (RTP multicast) → Core Recorder → Analytics → Products/Upload
                              20kHz DRF      D_clock    10Hz decimated
                              raw_archive/   phase2/    products/ → PSWS sftp

### ka9q-python Integration (V3.11)

The recording layer leverages **ka9q-python** for all RTP and channel management:

```
Application Layer (CoreRecorderV2, StreamRecorderV2)
        ↓
PipelineOrchestrator (Phase 1/2/3 coordination)
        ↓
ka9q-python RadiodStream (RTP reception, resequencing, decoding)
        ↓
ka9q-python RadiodControl (channel creation, configuration)
        ↓
ka9q-radio (radiod) via multicast
```

**ka9q-python provides:**
- **RadiodStream** - RTP reception, packet resequencing, gap detection, sample decoding
- **RadiodControl** - Channel creation, configuration, tune commands
- **discover_channels()** - Enumerate existing channels from radiod status
- **StreamQuality** - Completeness, packets lost/resequenced, gap metrics

### Generic Recording Infrastructure (New in V3)

The recording layer uses a **protocol-based design** enabling multiple applications:

```
Application Layer (GrapeRecorder, WsprRecorder, etc.)
        ↓
SegmentWriter Protocol (GrapeNPZWriter, WAVWriter, etc.)
        ↓
RecordingSession (generic RTP → segments)
        ↓
RTPReceiver + ka9q-python (multicast, parsing, timing)
```

**Key Abstractions:**
- **SegmentWriter Protocol** - Apps implement storage format
- **RecordingSession** - Generic packet flow, resequencing, segmentation
- **RTPReceiver** - Multi-SSRC demultiplexing, transport timing

### 1. Core Recorder (`src/grape_recorder/grape/core_recorder_v2.py`)

Rock-solid RTP capture using ka9q-python RadiodStream:
- Uses `RadiodStream` for RTP reception, resequencing, and sample decoding
- Uses `RadiodControl` for channel creation with anti-hijacking protection
- Deterministic multicast IP from station_id + instrument_id
- 20 kHz complex64 IQ → binary archive (1,200,000 samples/minute)

**Anti-hijacking:** Only modifies channels with our multicast destination. Creates new channels at same frequency if others exist (radiod supports multiple clients).

**20 kHz Archive Metadata** (self-contained scientific record):
- **IQ Data:** Complex64 samples, gap-filled with zeros
- **Timing Reference:** RTP timestamp of first sample, sample rate, SSRC
- **Time_snap Anchor:** RTP/UTC calibration from WWV/CHU tone detection
- **Tone Powers:** 1000 Hz (WWV) and 1200 Hz (WWVH) power levels in dB
- **NTP Status:** Wall clock time, NTP offset at minute boundary
- **Gap Provenance:** Detailed gap locations, sizes, and packet loss counts
- **Quality Indicators:** Packets received vs expected, completeness

### 2. Analytics Service (`src/grape_recorder/grape/analytics_service.py`)

Processes 20 kHz archives to derived products:

**Discrimination Methods** (each writes independent CSV):
- **Timing Tones:** 1000/1200 Hz power ratio (1/min)
- **Tick Windows:** 5ms coherent/incoherent SNR analysis (6/min)
- **440 Hz Station ID:** Unambiguous WWV/WWVH identification (2/hour)
- **BCD Correlation:** 100 Hz time code dual-peak detection (15/min)
- **Test Signals:** Minutes :08/:44 channel sounding (FSS, delay spread, noise coherence, ToA)
- **Weighted Voting:** Combines all methods for final determination

**Additional Analytics:**
- **Doppler Estimation:** Per-tick frequency shift measurement
- **Timing Metrics:** Time_snap quality, NTP drift, timing accuracy
- **Decimation:** 20 kHz → 10 Hz (optimized multi-stage CIC+FIR filter)

**Output:** Separated CSVs per method + 10 Hz NPZ with embedded metadata

### 3. DRF Writer (`src/grape_recorder/grape/drf_batch_writer.py`)

Wsprdaemon-compatible Digital RF output:
- Reads 10 Hz NPZ → writes Digital RF HDF5 (float32 I/Q pairs)
- Multi-subchannel format: all 9 frequencies in single ch0
- Automated SFTP upload to HamSCI PSWS with trigger directories

### Design Principles

- **Reprocessability:** 20 kHz archives preserved, analytics can rerun
- **Self-Contained Files:** Each NPZ contains all metadata for standalone analysis
- **Separation:** Core never stops, analytics restartable, DRF independent
- **Time_snap:** WWV/CHU tones anchor RTP to UTC (±1ms GPS-quality timing)

## Quality Metrics

- **Completeness:** 🟢 ≥99% | 🟡 95-99% | 🔴 <95%
- **Timing Drift:** RTP vs system clock (<±50ms healthy)
- **Packet Loss:** <1% healthy (indicates network issues)
- **Time_snap Quality:** TONE_LOCKED (±1ms) > NTP_SYNCED (±10ms) > WALL_CLOCK (±seconds)

## 🎯 Cross-Channel Coherent Timing

### Global Station Lock
Because radiod's RTP timestamps are **GPS-disciplined**, all 9 channels share a common timing reference. This enables treating multiple receivers as a **single coherent sensor array**.

**Implementation:**
- **Shared Filesystem IPC:** Uses `/dev/shm` (RAM disk) to share "Anchor" detections between isolated channel processes in real-time.
- **Unambiguous Anchors:** Strong stations (e.g., CHU, WWV 20 MHz) publish their precise timing.
- **Ambiguity Resolution:** Ambiguous stations (e.g., WWV vs WWVH on 10 MHz) use the Anchor to resolve the 15ms station separation.

**Three-Phase Detection:**
1. **Anchor Discovery** - Find high-confidence locks (SNR > 15 dB) across all channels
2. **Guided Search** - Use anchor timing to narrow weak-channel search from ±500 ms to **±6.5 ms** (Dispersion + Safety Margin)
   - *Result: 99.4% noise rejection and guaranteed station lock.*
3. **Coherent Stacking** - Virtual channel with SNR improvement of 10·log₁₀(N) dB

### Primary Time Standard (HF Time Transfer)

Back-calculate emission time from GPS-locked arrival time to **verify UTC(NIST)**:

```
T_emit = T_arrival - (τ_geo + τ_iono + τ_mode)
```

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **T_arrival** | GPS-disciplined RTP timestamp |
| **τ_geo** | Great-circle speed-of-light delay |
| **τ_iono** | Ionospheric group delay (frequency-dependent) |
| **τ_mode** | Extra path from N ionospheric hops |

**Propagation Mode Identification** (quantized by layer heights):

| Mode | Typical Delay | Uncertainty |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| 1-hop E | ~3.8 ms | ±0.20 ms |
| 1-hop F2 | ~4.3 ms | ±0.17 ms |
| 2-hop F2 | ~5.5 ms | ±0.33 ms |

**Accuracy Progression:**
- Raw arrival time: ±10 ms
- \+ Mode identification: ±2 ms
- \+ Cross-channel consensus: ±1 ms
- \+ Cross-station verification: ±0.5 ms

### PPM-Corrected Timing

ADC clock drift compensation with **sub-sample precision**:

- **Tone-to-tone PPM measurement** - Measures actual ADC clock vs nominal
- **Exponential smoothing** - Filters PPM estimates for stability
- **Parabolic interpolation** - Sub-sample peak detection (±10-25 μs at 20 kHz)
- **Clock ratio correction** - `elapsed_seconds = (rtp_elapsed / sample_rate) × clock_ratio`

**Ensemble Anchor Selection** - Cross-channel voting selects best time_snap source based on SNR, timing preference (WWV/CHU over WWVH), and quality metrics.

## 🔬 WWV/WWVH Discrimination (12 Voting Methods)

Separate WWV (Fort Collins) and WWVH (Kauai) signals on shared frequencies (2.5, 5, 10, 15 MHz) using complementary measurement techniques:

### Voting Methods

| Vote | Method | Weight | Description |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | **Test Signal** | 15 | Minutes :08/:44 scientific modulation test |
| 1 | **440 Hz Station ID** | 10 | WWVH min 1, WWV min 2 |
| 2 | **BCD Amplitude Ratio** | 2-10 | 100 Hz time code dual-peak detection |
| 3 | **1000/1200 Hz Power** | 1-10 | Timing tone power ratio |
| 4 | **Tick SNR Average** | 5 | 59-tick coherent integration |
| 5 | **500/600 Hz Ground Truth** | 10-15 | 12 exclusive minutes/hour (weight=15 for M16-19, M43-51) |
| 6 | **Doppler Stability** | 2 | Lower std = cleaner path (independent of power) |
| 7 | **Timing Coherence** | 3 | Test signal + BCD ToA agreement |
| 8 | **Harmonic Ratio** | 1.5 | 500→1000 Hz, 600→1200 Hz ratios |
| 9 | **FSS Path Signature** | 2 | Frequency Selectivity Score geographic validator |
| 10 | **Noise Coherence** | flag | Transient interference detection |
| 11 | **Burst ToA** | validation | High-precision timing cross-check |
| 12 | **Spreading Factor** | flag | Channel physics L = τ_D × f_D |

### Test Signal Channel Sounding (Minutes :08/:44)

The WWV/WWVH scientific test signal is fully exploited as a **channel sounding instrument**:

| Segment | Metric | Use |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Multi-tone** (13-23s) | FSS = 10·log₁₀((P₂ₖ+P₃ₖ)/(P₄ₖ+P₅ₖ)) | Geographic path validation |
| **White Noise** (10-12s, 37-39s) | N1 vs N2 coherence | Transient interference detection |
| **Chirps** (24-32s) | Delay spread τ_D | Multipath characterization |
| **Bursts** (34-36s) | High-precision ToA | Sub-ms timing reference |

### Inter-Method Cross-Validation (12 checks)

Beyond voting, independent measurements validate each other:
- **Power vs Timing** - BCD delay should match power ratio direction
- **Geographic Delay** - Measured delay vs predicted from receiver location
- **Doppler-Power Agreement** - Δf_D magnitude correlates with power
- **Coherence Quality** - Low coherence (<0.3) downgrades confidence
- **Harmonic Signature** - 500→1000 Hz, 600→1200 Hz ratios confirm station
- **FSS Geographic** - Path fingerprint matches scheduled station
- **Noise Transient** - N1/N2 difference flags interference events
- **Spreading Factor** - L = τ_D × f_D validates channel physics

### Why 12 Methods?
- **Redundancy:** Multiple independent measurements validate each other
- **Adaptability:** Different methods excel under different propagation conditions  
- **Temporal Coverage:** From hourly calibration to sub-second dynamics
- **Ground Truth:** 14 minutes/hour with 440/500/600 Hz exclusive broadcasts
- **Channel Sounding:** Test signal provides complete ionospheric characterization
- **Cross-Validation:** Agreement confirms accuracy, disagreement reveals mixed propagation

## Requirements

**Hardware:** SDR (RX888/Airspy/SDRPlay), HF antenna (2.5-25 MHz), Linux 2+ GB RAM  
**Software:** ka9q-radio, Python 3.10+, Node.js 18+, rsync, libhdf5-dev  
**Network:** Multicast-capable LAN, internet for PSWS upload

## Configuration Example

Edit `config/grape-config.toml` or use Web UI (recommended):

```toml
[station]
callsign = "AC0G"
grid_square = "EM38ww"

[recorder]
mode = "test"  # or "production"

[[recorder.channels]]
ssrc = 10000000
frequency_hz = 10000000
description = "WWV 10 MHz"
enabled = true

[uploader]
enabled = false  # Set true after PSWS credentials configured
```

## Workflow

**Setup:**
1. Install ka9q-radio
2. Run `./scripts/install.sh --mode test`
3. Edit `config/grape-config.toml` with station details
4. Test with `./scripts/grape-all.sh -start` (verify 5 min)
5. Deploy production: `sudo ./scripts/install.sh --mode production`
6. Configure PSWS SSH keys for uploads

**Daily Operation:** systemd services run 24/7, monitor web UI for 🟢 status, daily 00:30 UTC upload  
**Maintenance:** Check weekly via `journalctl -u grape-recorder`, verify uploads, review logs


## Troubleshooting

**No data:** Check `radiod` running, multicast routing, firewall (allow 5004/udp, 3000/tcp)  
**Completeness <99%:** Network congestion, multicast switch config  
**Timing drift >50ms:** Verify NTP (`timedatectl`), check radiod clock sync  
**Packet loss >1%:** Increase RTP buffer, check CPU, reduce channels
