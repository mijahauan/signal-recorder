# the station on its own (one eligible station in the band, so the
# hypothesis is unambiguous) and the marker is consulted for the whole
# second alone.  On a shared channel the marker also has to NAME the
# station, and that test refuses a displaced marker before the
# whole-second code is reached at all -- which is why the window the
# review measured is a dedicated-channel window.  B4, where the review
# took its numbers, runs dedicated WWV channels.
