"""The registration anchor closure is opt-in (task 17a).

The closure (spec §11, tasks 13-16) deployed to AC0G-ND on 2026-09-07,
engaged the anchor-direct FUSE feed twice, and both times reported a
POSITIVE host error while four NTP witnesses put the host fast; chrony
followed FUSE and slewed the host the wrong way.  Until the closure has
passed a live acceptance it must be OFF unless a station asks for it, and
"off" has to mean off at every one of the four surfaces the registration
reaches -- the ring, authority.json §18, the archive sidecar, and the
FUSE chrony feed.

Every test here states the same thing twice: what the surface does with
the flag false, and that the answer matches what the code did at
c7b2106, the commit before the closure landed.  The legacy answer is not
re-derived from a fixture: it is computed from the pre-closure algorithm
written out beside the assertion, so the comparison stays honest if the
closure's own arithmetic changes.
