"""ONE gate for every surface the registration reaches (fix round 1, C-1).

The review measured the hole.  `T3RegistrationAnchor` demanded
`state == "ACQUIRED"` and `verified is True`; `HfAcquiredBench.poll`
admitted ACQUIRED **or** WITNESS and never read `verified` at all -- and
the FUSE chrony block comes from the bench reading, not from the
`LabelAnchor` the other three surfaces share.  So:

    state=ACQUIRED  verified=False   ring/§18/sidecar refused, chrony FED
    state=WITNESS   verified=True    ring/§18/sidecar refused, chrony FED
    state=WITNESS   verified=False   ring/§18/sidecar refused, chrony FED

An unverified plane can sit on a fold-lattice phantom -- two channels can
share one lattice, and `FUSE_OUTLIER_MS` bounds disagreement between
members, not a common-mode lattice error.  A plane good enough to
discipline the host clock is a plane good enough to label the samples;
there is no honest reading on which those two differ.

`registration_store.registration_refusal` is now THE one gate, and this
file walks all four surfaces through the same three cases.
