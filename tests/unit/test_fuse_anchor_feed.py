"""The FUSE feed carries the anchor, not the host clock (spec §11.2,
revised 2026-09-07).

Today's FUSE sample is ``system_time − d_clock``.  d_clock is fusion's
estimate of the HOST clock's offset from the plane the measurements were
labelled on — so when the ring plane and the host clock are the same
thing (radiod stamps GPS_TIME from the host clock), d_clock ≈ 0 votes
"the host is right" however far the host has walked.  That is the
AC0G-ND 2026-09-07 mechanism.

The fix is not to add a correction to d_clock.  It is to hand chrony the
measurement pair the label-plane anchor already forms:

    reference_time = anchor's UTC of the newest arrived sample
    system_time    = the host clock AT THAT ARRIVAL INSTANT

chrony's own offset is then ``reference − system`` — the host clock's
error against the tick-aligned UTC, measured once, with no d_clock term
anywhere in it.  Nothing is summed, so nothing can be double-counted.
