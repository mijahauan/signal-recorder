"""The sign contradiction gets watched, not acted on (task 17c).

AC0G-ND, 2026-09-07.  The anchor-direct FUSE feed engaged at 20:41Z and
21:21Z and both times reported the host clock SLOW -- +23..28 ms, then
+60.5 ms -- while four NTP witnesses put the host FAST by +13 and
+30 ms.  chrony followed FUSE and slewed the host the wrong way.  Which
of the two is right is still unknown, and it cannot be settled from the
station's own frame while the closure has every surface on one plane.

So fusion states the three numbers side by side, once a minute, at INFO,
whether or not the closure is on:

    anchor-direct WOULD feed (reference−system, +ve = host slow):
    anchor +60.5 ms | NTP pool -30.0 ms | ring−registration +0.0 ms

⛔ THIS FILE EXISTS TO PIN THE SIGNS.  Review C1 and C2 found two of the
three terms carrying the opposite convention to the one the line claimed,
and the first version of these tests could not see it: they asserted that
the median arithmetic worked and that the string formatted, never that a
number meant what it said.  So every test below states a PHYSICAL
situation -- the host is fast, the host is slow, the two planes agree --
and asserts the printed sign against it.

The three sources disagree natively and each is converted exactly once,
inside ``anchor_sign_line``:

    anchor    LabelPlaneAnchorSample.offset_s   reference − system  as-is
    NTP pool  chronyc -c sources field 7        system − reference  negated
    d_clock   FusedResult.d_clock_fused_ms      system − reference  negated
