"""authority.json §18 states the anchor's own UTC (task 14a, 2026-09-07).

The other half of "every consumer reads it".  Task 13 put the verified
registration into the ring and into chrony; §18 -- the versioned surface
psk, wspr and meteor-scatter key off -- was still publishing
``gps_unix + judge_offset``, i.e. radiod's host-stamped pair with a
correction bolted on.  On a station whose judge best-bench is FusionBench
(host plane), a subscriber therefore still read a host-derived anchor
while the ticks said otherwise.

mjh's ruling: wherever a label-plane native anchor is in force, that
anchor is the ONLY source of RTP->UTC for every published surface.  The
judge stays a witness -- its verdict still measures the pair and still
drives violation and escalation -- but it no longer defines the plane.
