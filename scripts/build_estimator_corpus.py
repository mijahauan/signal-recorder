"""Build witness traces for the estimator's acceptance tests. One-time tool.

Reads a fixture's compressed IQ and sidecar, folds the tick envelope in short
blocks, and writes one phase observation per block per band. The absolute UTC
carries an unknown constant (propagation plus station identity), so the traces
support rate and behaviour tests and never an absolute accuracy claim.
