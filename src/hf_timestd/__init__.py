HF Time Standard Analysis (hf_timestd)

A system for receiving and analyzing HF time standard broadcasts (WWV/WWVH/CHU)
via ka9q-radio RTP streams. Produces precise timing measurements (D_clock) for
UTC alignment and clock discipline.

Key Features:
- Phase 1: Core recording of 20 kHz IQ data to Digital RF archive
- Phase 2: Timing analysis - tone detection, station discrimination, D_clock
- Multi-broadcast fusion for UTC(NIST) convergence
- Chrony SHM integration for system clock discipline

Quick Start:
    from hf_timestd import subscribe_stream
    
    # Get a stream (no SSRC needed!)
    stream = subscribe_stream(
        radiod="radiod.local",
        frequency_hz=10.0e6,
        preset="iq",
        sample_rate=20000
    )
    
    print(f"Receiving on {stream.multicast_address}:{stream.port}")

See ARCHITECTURE.md for design details.
