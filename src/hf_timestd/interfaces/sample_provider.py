    Interface for Function 1: Quality & Time_Snap Analysis
    
    This is the primary producer in the GRAPE architecture.
    It receives RTP packets, performs resequencing, gap detection,
    time_snap correction, and quality analysis.
    
    All downstream functions (2-5) consume samples from this interface.
    
    Design principle:
        Consumers don't need to know about RTP packets, sequence numbers,
        or resequencing logic. They only see quality-analyzed samples
        with corrected timestamps.
