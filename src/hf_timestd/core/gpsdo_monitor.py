GPSDO Monitoring Architecture for Grape Recorder

This module implements the "Set, Monitor, Intervention" strategy for GPSDO-disciplined
timing. Instead of constantly recalibrating the time anchor from noisy tone detections,
we trust the GPSDO's "steel ruler" and use tone detections only for verification.

Architecture:
    STARTUP → STEADY_STATE → (HOLDOVER) → STEADY_STATE
                   ↓
           Sample Loss Detected → REANCHOR_REQUIRED → STARTUP

Key Principles:
    1. Trust the Counter: Determine time by counting samples from the last known good
       anchor (TimeSnapReference), trusting the GPSDO hardware.
    
    2. Verify, Don't Reset: Use received tones to audit the counter. Only update the
       TimeSnapReference if error exceeds a "Physics Threshold" (> 3ms, which is
       impossible from just ionospheric jitter).
    
    3. Fail-Safe: Instantaneously invalidate TimeSnapReference if radiod reports
       dropped packets, forcing fresh anchor establishment.

Monitors:
    A. Sample Integrity Watchdog - Detects if "ruler" broke (data loss)
    B. Drift Watchdog - Confirms GPSDO hasn't unlocked (PPM alarm)
