"""RegistrationAcquirer — the received ticks place the second boundary.

Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-06-t3-self-registration-design.md.

The registration ``utc(sample) = sample0_utc + sample/sample_rate`` has a
rate (the GPSDO's, needs no help) and an origin (a measurement).  Before
this module the origin came from radiod's non-atomic (GPS_TIME,
RTP_TIMESNAP) pair, and the ±20 ms tick search around it could not
re-find the second when the pair landed off (232 ms on ND, 701 ms on
B4, 2026-09-06).  Here the tick train itself places the second: fold the
band-limited envelope at one second, find the peaks, fit them to the
expected station delays by a common shift, hold the result in the RTP
frame, and corroborate or correct it every minute.

When one folded peak fits two stations (WWV or BPM on a shared channel)
and no sibling channel can choose, the 800 ms minute marker does: WWV and
WWVH transmit one, BPM does not (spec §12, task 15).

Sign convention (pinned in the plan's Global Constraints):
    correction_s = expected_delay_s - fold_position_s, wrapped to (-0.5, 0.5]
    sample0_utc_acquired = sample0_utc_label + correction_s

        ACQUIRED plane, per-tick sigma).  Only tick-like ensembles
        (sigma ≤ TIMING_SIGMA_MAX_MS) count.

        An unverified (CANDIDATE) registration must pass ``verify`` first
        (task-11b); routed here rather than tightened blindly.

        ONE floor, ``ORIGIN_SIGMA_FLOOR_MS`` = 1 ms, governs the new
        evidence's weight, the accumulated estimate's weight, and the
        registration sigma itself (final review, C2 + I5).  That floor is
        the DELAY-MODEL ACCURACY bound, not a repeatability bound: this
        sigma comes from fold SNR and tick rise time divided by sqrt(n), so
        it measures how repeatably the ticks land, while the acquired
        origin's accuracy is bounded by ``expected_delays_s`` -- the
        great-circle/F2-hop propagation model, and mode ambiguity (1F vs 2F
        is milliseconds).  Publishing 0.17 ms for a quantity whose
        systematic floor sits several milliseconds up let the Offset
        Judge's same-tier sigma tie-break hand the PUBLISHED T3 offset to
        ``hf_acquired`` instead of ``FusionBench`` within the first hour on
        a live station -- a change of operative timing authority spec §6
        does not sanction.

        Flooring both weights equally also makes the filter what spec §5
        asks for: "on the GPSDO the true origin is constant, so the filter
        is a running weighted mean with a long memory, not a tracker".
        With ``w_new`` floored at 0.1 ms and ``w_old`` at 1.0 ms, a
        realistic 0.4 ms per-tick sigma under-weighted the history 6.25x
        per minute and the effective memory was about five minutes -- short
        enough to follow the ionosphere's path-delay wander into the
        origin, which is spec §10's last risk row."""
