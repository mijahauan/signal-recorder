"""
AuthorityManager — selects, cross-checks, and publishes the active
Timing Authority level per METROLOGY.md §4.5 / §4.6.

The manager is the single writer of /run/hf-timestd/authority.json and
the single policy layer above the existing chrony/NTP/mDNS transport.
It never mutates the system clock; it only classifies, selects, and
publishes.  D_clock is a derived quantity handed to chrony, and chrony
steps (MEASUREMENT_MODEL.md §7.1).

This module is intentionally free of service dependencies:
  - Probes are injected (anything matching the Probe protocol).
  - The A-level is provided via a callable so hardware detection can
    live elsewhere.
  - The "now" source is injectable for deterministic testing.

Concrete probes (FusionStatusProbe, chrony-based probes, the BPSK-PPS
and LB-1421 probes) live in their own modules and are composed by the
service entrypoint.
