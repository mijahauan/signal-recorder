"""Cross-process shared-memory ring buffer — producer side.

Phase 1 of the ring-buffer refactor.  One writer (the core-recorder) writes
IQ samples into a per-channel SysV shared-memory segment so that multiple
readers (metrology workers, the archive writer, future clients)
can consume the same stream without coupling to file I/O cadence.

Protocol summary
----------------
- One segment per channel, keyed deterministically from the channel name.
- Fixed 4 KiB header followed by a `complex64` sample region of length
  `sample_rate * ring_seconds`.
- The producer is the only writer.  Readers never block the producer.
- The producer publishes each batch by:
    1. Copying samples into the ring at `write_cursor % ring_size`.
    2. Publishing the per-batch RTP anchor (`batch_first_rtp`,
       `batch_cursor_pos`) so readers can map any sample index to an RTP
       timestamp.
    3. Performing a single atomic 8-byte store of the new
       `write_cursor_samples`.  On x86-64 this is the release point.
- The GPS_TIME / RTP_TIMESNAP anchor is seqlock-protected by
  `epoch_counter` and `anchor_epoch_counter_mirror`.  Producer bumps
  epoch_counter on every re-seed; readers retry while the two disagree.
- Platform gate: the seqlock assumes TSO memory ordering, so creation
  refuses non-x86 hosts.  aarch64 support would require an explicit
  release fence (deferred).

The full plan, including phasing and rollback notes, lives at
`~/.claude/plans/silly-squishing-parnas.md`.

#: How deep the ring must be, in seconds.

#: The ring feeds metrology, which reads 60-second windows aligned to UTC
#: minute boundaries with no file I/O on the hot path. Its depth is therefore
#: that window plus slack for a worker that falls behind — it has nothing to
#: do with the archive's chunk duration.
#:
#: It used to be sized by `tiered_storage.calculate_hot_minutes()`, the
#: ARCHIVE's policy, whose floor is "one whole chunk plus margin". That pinned
#: the ring at 7-11 minutes to serve a 60-second requirement: 461-725 MB of
#: unreclaimable shared memory across six channels, on a 9.3 GB host that was
#: OOM-killing the recorder that owns it. Sizing a buffer by someone else's
#: constraint is how that happened; these constants exist so it cannot recur.
