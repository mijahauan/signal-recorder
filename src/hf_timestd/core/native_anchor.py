"""hf-timestd-native RTP→UTC anchor.

The matched-filter detection of the BPSK-injected GPS PPS in the HF
stream tells us the RTP sample at which a 1-PPS edge fired, to
sub-µs precision.  The LB-1421 USB-NMEA tells us which UTC second
that PPS belongs to, to USB-jitter precision.  Pairing the two ONCE
at first lock yields an anchor

    (anchor_rtp, anchor_utc_ns, sample_rate_hz)

from which every subsequent sample's UTC label is pure arithmetic:

    utc_ns(rtp) = anchor_utc_ns + (rtp − anchor_rtp) × 10⁹ / sample_rate_hz

The GPSDO disciplines ``sample_rate_hz`` exactly, so the arithmetic
stays accurate for as long as GPSDO lock holds — no continuous
"drift correction" against a host-clock-derived projection, no
re-anchoring against radiod's (gps_time, rtp_timesnap), no chrony
state in the loop.  This is the substrate position the architecture
docs describe (see ``docs/ARCHITECTURE-FIRST-PRINCIPLES.md`` §1 and
``docs/TIMING-PIPELINE-WIRING.md`` §1).

The 32-bit RTP-wrap disambiguation logic is lifted from
``ka9q.rtp_recorder.rtp_to_wallclock`` (the math is correct there;
only the *anchor* needs to come from a non-host-clock-poisoned
source).  Unlike ``rtp_to_wallclock`` we deliberately do NOT fall
back to ``time.time()`` when the wrap epoch is ambiguous — the
caller passes an explicit hint or accepts the anchor's own captured
moment as the disambiguator.  Host clock is never consulted.
