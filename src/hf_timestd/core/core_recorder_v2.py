HF Time Standard Core Recorder V2 - Using ka9q-python RadiodStream

ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION (v3.11+, Dec 2025)
This is the primary recorder implementation, replacing the legacy `CoreRecorder` (v1)
and `RTPReceiver`.

Simplified recorder that uses ka9q-python's RadiodStream for RTP handling.
This eliminates custom RTPReceiver and PacketResequencer code.

Responsibilities:
1. Discover/create channels in radiod via ka9q-python
2. Create RadiodStream for each channel
3. Receive decoded IQ samples via callback
4. Write to Phase 1 archive and queue for Phase 2/3

ka9q-python handles:
- RTP packet reception
- Packet resequencing
- Gap detection and filling
- Sample decoding
- Quality metrics

        channels do a synchronous zstd + fsync flush on the receive
        thread every ``file_duration_sec`` (default 10 min) which takes
        seconds while ~10 channels' worth of compressed data is written

        overflowed, T6 dropped samples, the Costas loop unlocked, and
        chrony saw TSL3 ``?`` (reach=0) every 10 minutes.  A dedicated
        T6 socket and thread reads packets continuously regardless of
        what the archive thread is doing.

    # off by 24 samples (≈ +252 µs), then re-locked −381 µs after a
    # restart that captured a different fusion bias — both wide enough to
    # make chrony flag TSL3 as a falseticker.  T4 chronyc tracking against
    # a healthy LAN GPS routinely sits at ~1 µs RMS, which IS tight enough
    # for sub-sample disambiguation.
    #
    # 10 µs ≈ one sample period at 96 kHz — the threshold below which a

    # disambiguation from the persisted value with no T4 dependence.

    # Set to 0.010 ms rather than the theoretical 0.005 ms (half-sample)

    # actual jitter, chrony often reports RMS in the 4-8 µs range.  Half-
    # sample-period gating rejected T4 ~half the time on bee1 2026-05-23

        ## RTP-reference invariant (METROLOGY.md §4.5)

        Per the project-wide invariant, **data-label authority must be
        derivable from RTP + a fusion-or-peer-derived offset, never from
        the host wall clock**.  The reference order below reflects that:

          - **T5** (highest): on-host GPS+PPS chrony refclock — direct
            peer authority, no wall-clock dependence.  Not yet wired.
          - **T3**: HF Fusion offset via
            ``/run/hf-timestd/fusion_status.json``.  Listed first as
            the invariant-cleanest source, but **in practice rejected
            by the sigma gate** — HF fusion's steady-state uncertainty
            (sub-ms at best) is far wider than the sample period
            (~10 µs at 96 kHz), so the integer-sample disambiguation
            it produces is unreliable.  Bee1 2026-05-23: a T3 fusion
            disambig with σ=4.3 ms picked a wrap off by 24 samples
            (+252 µs), then re-locked −381 µs after restart — both
            wide enough that chrony marked TSL3 a falseticker.
          - **T4** (practical bootstrap): LAN GPS+PPS via
            ``chronyc tracking``.  Reads ``system_clock − true_UTC``;
            superficially appears to couple disambig to the host wall
            clock, but the invariant is preserved through the
            *persistence* mechanism: T4 is consulted ONCE per
            restart-window to pick the integer wrap, the result is
            written to ``/var/lib/timestd/bpsk_*_chain_delay.json``,
            and every subsequent cycle re-derives disambiguation from
            that RF-path-invariant value with no further T4 reads.
            Per-sample data labeling continues to use T3 fusion as
            the authority offset; T4 only resolves the integer-wrap
            ambiguity at the moment of physical lock.
