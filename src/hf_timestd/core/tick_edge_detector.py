Tick Edge Detector — Per-Second Matched Filter Timing for WWV/WWVH/BPM
========================================================================

Extracts UTC timing from per-second ticks using the approach proven by the
ntpd Type 36 driver (refclock_wwv.c, D.L. Mills, University of Delaware):

1. **Matched filter** for the exact tick shape:
   - WWV:  5 cycles of 1000 Hz (5.0 ms)
   - WWVH: 6 cycles of 1200 Hz (5.0 ms)
   - BPM:  10 cycles of 1000 Hz (10 ms)

2. **Front-edge back-calculation**: The correlation peak corresponds to the
   CENTER of the tick pulse.  The on-time marker is the LEADING EDGE.
   We subtract half the tick duration from the peak position to recover
   the front edge with sub-sample precision.

3. **Ensemble combination**: Combine timing from all detected ticks in the
   minute using SNR-weighted robust median.

This overcomes the two problems that forced us to drop 5ms WWV/WWVH ticks:

- **Intermodulation**: The 10ms silence zone before each tick (NIST SP 432)
  suppresses the intermod pedestal.  The matched filter's narrow bandwidth
  (5 cycles = 5ms = 200 Hz effective bandwidth) rejects out-of-band energy.
  The quadrature (I/Q) matched filter is phase-invariant, so the intermod
  pedestal (which has arbitrary phase) adds only to the noise floor, not
  to the peak.

- **Low processing gain**: A single 5ms tick at 24 kHz gives 120 samples
  and ~21 dB processing gain.  With 57 ticks per minute combined via
  ensemble median, effective gain is 21 + 10*log10(57) ≈ 38.6 dB.

Signal structure (NIST SP 432):
    Each tick is preceded by 10ms of silence and followed by 25ms of silence.
    The on-time marker is the START of the 5ms tone burst.
    Ticks are at 100% modulation; audio tones at 50%.

Audio tone schedule (determines intermod environment):
    WWV:  even minutes → 500 Hz, odd → 600 Hz, min 2 → 440 Hz
          Silent: minutes 43-51, 29, 59
    WWVH: even minutes → 600 Hz, odd → 500 Hz, min 1 → 440 Hz
          Silent: minutes 0, 8-10, 14-19, 30

    When one station's audio tone is silent, the other station's ticks
    are free of intermod contamination — these are "clean calibration"
    minutes with higher detection confidence.

        Estimate Doppler (Hz) from carrier-phase slope across the minute.

        Fits φ(t) = 2π·f_D·t + φ₀ in absolute UTC time, SNR-weighted, with
        a slip-safe two-step unwrap that survives missing ticks. Returns
        ``(doppler_hz, doppler_uncertainty_hz)``; either is ``None`` when
        too little usable data exists.

        Why not ``np.unwrap`` over ``sec_in_minute``?  np.unwrap's ±π
        adjacency rule is per-sample, not per-second, so a missing tick
        (Δt = 2 s) plus a real Doppler |f| > 0.25 Hz already exceeds ±π
        and is misclassified as a 2π slip. We instead seed the rate from
        Δt ≤ 1.5 s pairs only — where the wrap is unambiguous for the
        ±0.5 Hz band that survives 1-Hz sampling — then unwrap the full
        series against that seed line.

        Why SNR weighting?  Matched-filter phase σ ∝ 1/SNR_amp, so a
        15 dB tick has 1/8 the phase variance of a 3 dB tick.
        ``np.polyfit`` treats its ``w`` argument as 1/σ, so weights are
        the amplitude SNR (10^(SNR_dB/20)).

        Intrinsic limit (cannot be lifted at 1-Hz sampling): the
        adjacent-tick wrap resolves Doppler only within ±0.5 Hz. The
        residual baseband Doppler seen *after* the minute-marker carrier
        lock comfortably fits this band; bulk-channel Doppler is already
        absorbed by the lock.
