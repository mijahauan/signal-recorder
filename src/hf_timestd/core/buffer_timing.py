Buffer Timing: Sample-to-UTC Mapping
=====================================

A buffer is a contiguous sequence of IQ samples recorded at a GPSDO-locked
sample rate (exactly 24000 Hz).  This module answers one question:

    What UTC time does sample N correspond to?

The answer comes from the RTP timestamp chain — the sole timing authority:

    sample0_utc = GPS_TIME_unix + (start_rtp - RTP_TIMESNAP) / sample_rate

Every buffer's metadata contains:
  - start_rtp_timestamp: RTP timestamp of sample 0
  - gps_time_ns: GPS_TIME (ns since GPS epoch) — from the writer.  ⚠ On
    AC0G-B4 2026-08-25 this field and rtp_timesnap were FROZEN across
    five consecutive sidecars while start_rtp_timestamp advanced by
    exactly 7,200,000 samples each: the writer captures the pair once and
    never refreshes it, so a reader mapping RTP→UTC from these two fields
    can be hours out.  Prefer the anchor ledger.
  - rtp_timesnap: RTP counter at GPS_TIME — from the writer; see above
  - timing_snapshots[]: GPS_TIME / RTP_TIMESNAP pairs (legacy, used as fallback)

⚠ GPS_TIME is NOT GPSDO-disciplined ground truth, RTP_TIMESNAP is NOT
"the RTP counter at the moment GPS_TIME was sampled", and the two are NOT
in the same counter space (hf-timestd#37).  Per ka9q-radio source:

  * GPS_TIME is ``gps_time_ns()`` evaluated as the status packet is built
    (radio_status.c:718-719); ``gps_time_ns()`` is
    ``clock_gettime(CLOCK_TAI)`` offset to the GPS epoch (misc.c:546-563)
    — the HOST SYSTEM CLOCK, not a sample index.
  * RTP_TIMESNAP is ``chan->output.rtp.timestamp`` (radio_status.c:859),
    the next RTP timestamp to be sent, advanced per emitted block
    (audio.c:49-51, 177-179) — quantised to the 20 ms block grid plus
    that emission's lateness.
  * The sample index the old claim was reaching for is INPUT_SAMPLES =
    ``chan->filter.out.sample_index`` (radio_status.c:720).

Measured on AC0G-B4 2026-08-25: 20,813,617 pair updates, max
disagreement +816.4 ms, only ~37 % at exactly 0.  The error is one-sided
lateness — GPS_TIME is read live, RTP_TIMESNAP reflects the last
emission.  So the formula below does NOT give the exact UTC of an RTP
timestamp; it gives it to within that pair error.

⛔ Do not use this mapping where precision matters.  T6 sets the RTP→UTC
mapping and keeps the host clock out of it
(docs/design/T6_ANCHOR_INVERSION_DESIGN.md,
docs/design/TIMING_AUTHORITY_TWO_AXIS.md §2).

In the measurement model's vocabulary (docs/design/MEASUREMENT_MODEL.md
§7.2) the label this module computes carries ``origin: sysclock``: it
descends from radiod's pair, a host-clock reading, until the TimeMap
replaces it.  The provenance sidecar should record it under that word.

start_system_time is NEVER used for timing.  It is logged for diagnostics
only.  The writer computes it from its own (possibly stale) GPS/RTP
mapping, which can be wrong by seconds or more after a radiod restart.
