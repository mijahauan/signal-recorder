"""The verified registration IS the T3 anchor (spec §11, 2026-09-07).

Live on AC0G-ND, 2026-09-07: six channels acquired and verified a
registration from the received WWV/WWVH tick train, corroborated it
against the 800 ms minute marker every minute, and held it to a
millisecond — while the host clock walked 150 ms away from four NTP
witnesses and the psk decodes died.  The ticks were right and nothing
carried them to the anchor the clients read.

Michael's ruling on the shape of the fix (2026-09-07):

    "Why do we compare things to the host clock?  It is not the ruler or
    the standard but a product of FUSION.  Imagine there is no host clock
    at all, but ONLY FUSION."

So this module does NOT express the anchor as "radiod's host-stamped
(GPS_TIME, RTP_TIMESNAP) pair plus a judge offset".  It expresses the
registration the way T6 already expresses its own anchor — as a
:class:`~hf_timestd.core.native_anchor.NativeAnchor`, a captured
(RTP, UTC) pairing from which every label is pure counter arithmetic:

    utc_ns(rtp) = anchor_utc_ns + (rtp − anchor_rtp) × 10⁹ / sample_rate_hz

``chain_delay_ns`` is 0 because the registration is already a plane, not
an edge: ``utc_ref`` is the UTC of the sample at ``rtp_ref``, with the
propagation model (``expected_delay − fold_position``) already removed by
the acquirer.  There is no second RF term to subtract.

The gates below are all liveness and provenance — never a comparison
against the host clock:

* a T6 native anchor that is AUTHORITATIVE owns the plane, and one
  station publishes ONE registration (mjh, 2026-09-04), so T3 stands
  down while T6 stands up;
* every gate in :func:`registration_store.registration_refusal` --
  state ACQUIRED, ``verified`` true, fresh against the store's own
  stale window, counter domain matching.  That function is THE one gate
  (fix round 1, review finding C-1): the FUSE chrony feed asks it too,
  so a plane refused for the ring can never reach the host clock
  instead.
