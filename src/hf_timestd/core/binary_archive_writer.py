Binary Archive Writer - Simple, robust raw IQ storage

Writes raw complex64 binary files with JSON metadata sidecars.
Designed for maximum reliability - append-only, no HDF5 complexity.

Architecture:
- One binary file per minute per channel
- JSON sidecar with timestamps and metadata
- Memory-mappable for zero-copy Phase 2 reading
- Optional async compression of completed minutes

File structure:
    raw_buffer/{CHANNEL}/YYYYMMDD/
        1765031100.bin      # Raw complex64 samples
        1765031100.json     # Metadata sidecar
        1765031040.bin.zst  # Compressed older minute (optional)

Timing provenance (docs/design/MEASUREMENT_MODEL.md §7.2): the sidecar's
start time descends from radiod's GPS_TIME/RTP_TIMESNAP pair, so its
origin is ``sysclock`` in the model's word.  The registration that
corrects it lives in the anchor ledger and the Offset Judge, not here.
