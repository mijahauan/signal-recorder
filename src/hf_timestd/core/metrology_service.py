"""
Metrology Service
=================
Real-time DSP and Timestamping Service.

Responsibility:
1. Ingest raw IQ data from the core-recorder's shared-memory ring buffer.
2. Run MetrologyEngine (Tone Detection, Channel Characterization).
3. Write L1 and L2 metrology data products (HDF5 + SQLite).
4. Compute the per-channel edge-ensemble timing residual
   (``d_clock_ms`` on L2 tick_timing) -- this IS a clock-offset
   measurement, but it is **per-channel** and **not** yet fused
   across stations and **not** wired to chrony.  Fusion (the
   `timestd-fusion` service) is what takes these per-channel
   residuals and produces the chrony SHM update.

(§3.4 Low: docstring line 11 used to say "Do NOT perform ... clock
offset calculation"; that was stale -- this service has computed
edge-ensemble d_clock_ms since TickEdgeDetector landed.  Reconciled
2026-05-20.)

Data path
---------
`timestd-core-recorder` publishes each batch of samples into a per-channel
SysV ring buffer (see :mod:`hf_timestd.core.ring_buffer`).  This service
attaches to the ring for its own channel and extracts 60-second windows
aligned to UTC minute boundaries.  There is no file I/O on the hot path.
The archive writer in the recorder handles long-term .bin.zst chunks
independently of metrology latency.

    # tell those minutes from real ones.

    # Measured over ~8,780 minutes per channel on AC0G-B4, the other
    # per-minute statistics CANNOT separate the cases:

    #     against 0.56 on the well-received ones);
    #   * doppler uncertainty is ~0.0022 Hz everywhere.
    # SNR is the field that separates, because the bands really do open:
    # 20 MHz reaches 37.4 dB and 25 MHz 33.3 dB when they work, against
    # a ~9 dB floor when they do not.
