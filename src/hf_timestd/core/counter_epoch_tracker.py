"""CounterEpochTracker — the live-ring twin of the recorder's
``binary_archive_writer._note_counter_epoch``.

radiod's (GPS_TIME, RTP_TIMESNAP) pair is re-adopted at every radiod or
recorder restart.  Within one counter space every pair implies the same
RTP→UTC mapping to within the pair's own skew; a jump past that means the
RTP counter space itself changed, and every registration held in the old
RTP frame is void (T3 self-registration spec §5, "step on counter-epoch
change").

This tracker exists because the live ring (metrology_engine) needs the
same open/keep decision the recorder's archive writer already makes,
so an ``acquired`` origin (BufferTiming.origin_source) is discarded the
instant the epoch it was registered in closes.

**The epoch is a MEASURED QUANTITY, not a name** (final review, C1).
``epoch_offset_s`` — ``gps_time_ns/1e9 − rtp_timesnap/sample_rate``, the
UTC of RTP sample 0 — is what every channel on one radiod agrees on, and
it is what ``registration_store.fuse_registrations`` clusters by.  The id
string is informational: metrology runs one process per channel, each
tracker samples the ring's anchor at its own phase, so two channels in one
physical epoch can name it differently and nothing downstream may depend
on the strings matching.

**Lateness is not a new epoch** (final review, I3).  radiod samples
GPS_TIME live and RTP_TIMESNAP from a cached block field, so consecutive
pairs are independent draws from a ONE-SIDED lateness distribution — 232 ms
on AC0G-ND, 701 ms with a tail to 816 ms on AC0G-B4 (spec §1).  Predicting
from the LAST pair therefore opened a spurious epoch on B4 roughly whenever
a late sample followed an early one, and every spurious epoch throws the
registration away.  This tracker keeps a RUNNING MINIMUM of the implied
offset instead: skew only makes GPS_TIME late, so the least-late pair seen
is the truest mapping.  A new epoch opens when a pair implies an offset
BELOW that minimum by more than ``COUNTER_EPOCH_STEP_S`` (impossible within
one epoch) or ABOVE it by more than ``COUNTER_EPOCH_SKEW_ALLOWANCE_S``.

Two consequences worth stating plainly:

* **The recorder's own tracker is unchanged.**  ``binary_archive_writer``
  still predicts from the last adopted pair and still names its epochs
  ``pair-<gps>``, where this one names them ``ep-<int(offset_s)>``.  The
  two also observe different subsamples of the pair stream (per-adoption
  there, per-minute here), so their boundaries can fall at different times
  and their ids never match.  Do not try to correlate
  ``registration.counter_epoch_id`` with a chunk sidecar's.
* **A genuine re-anchor smaller than ``COUNTER_EPOCH_SKEW_ALLOWANCE_S``
  would be missed.**  Real re-anchors move the mapping by hours; the
  allowance buys immunity to a 0.8 s skew at the cost of blindness to a
  hypothetical sub-2-second one.

The prediction arithmetic — including RTP wrap handling, which is why the
running minimum is carried as a PAIR rather than as a bare float — is the
recorder's.
