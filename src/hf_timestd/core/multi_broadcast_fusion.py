Multi-Broadcast D_clock Fusion Engine

================================================================================
PURPOSE
================================================================================
Combine D_clock estimates from all available broadcasts to produce a
HIGH-ACCURACY UTC(NIST) time estimate through weighted fusion and
auto-calibration.

The fused D_clock should converge to 0ms, indicating perfect alignment
with UTC(NIST).

================================================================================
THREE-LAYER METROLOGICAL ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================
Understanding the fundamental difference between Frequency Stability (Slope)
and Time Accuracy (Offset):

LAYER 1: Single Broadcast — "The Floating Ruler"
    - Measures stability of local clock's tick rate relative to transmitter
    - NOT anchored to UTC — signal always arrives late by propagation delay
    - Result: Perfect slope (frequency), but shifted by ~8ms average delay
    - You know HOW FAST time is passing, but not WHAT TIME IT IS

LAYER 2: Single Station, Multiple Frequencies — "The Dispersion Anchor"
    - Multiple frequencies (5, 10, 15 MHz) unlock dispersion calculation
    - Lower frequencies delayed MORE by ionosphere than higher ones
    - Calculate TEC → compute ionospheric delay → subtract it
    - Result: Characterizes PATH PHYSICS, moves floating ruler toward UTC

LAYER 3: Multiple Stations (14 Broadcasts) — "The Geometry Lock"
    - Geography (WWV vs WWVH vs BPM) sounds ionosphere from different angles
    - Cancels localized anomalies ("Weather") — solar flares affect paths differently
    - Result: "Triangulates" ionosphere globally, provides INTEGRITY (validation)

THE "STEEL RULER" SUMMARY:
    GPSDO                      → Slope (Rate)         → Ruler is straight and rigid
    Multi-Frequency Dispersion → Vertical Shift       → Calibrates zero-point per station
    Multi-Station Fusion       → Integrity            → Zero-point consistent across hemisphere

KEY INSIGHT: Combined regression of 17 broadcasts doesn't just average noise —
it SOLVES THE GEOMETRY of the ionosphere to find the true UTC origin point.

================================================================================
BROADCAST STRUCTURE
================================================================================
The hf-timestd system monitors up to 17 time signal broadcasts:

    STATION | FREQUENCIES
    --------|----------------------------------------------------
    WWV     | 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 MHz (6 broadcasts)
    WWVH    | 2.5, 5, 10, 15 MHz (4 broadcasts, shared with WWV)
    BPM     | 2.5, 5, 10, 15 MHz (4 broadcasts, shared with WWV/WWVH)

SHARED vs UNIQUE FREQUENCIES:
    - Shared (WWV + WWVH + BPM): 2.5, 5, 10, 15 MHz → 12 broadcasts (need discrimination)
    - WWV-only: 20, 25 MHz → 2 broadcasts

BPM SPECIAL HANDLING:
    - Minutes 25-29, 55-59: UT1 timing (DO NOT USE for UTC without DUT1 correction)
    - Minutes 0-24, 30-54: UTC timing (usable)
    - Tick duration: 10ms (UTC) vs 100ms (UT1) - used for mode detection

================================================================================
FUSION THEORY
================================================================================
Each broadcast provides an independent D_clock estimate:

    D_clock_i = T_arrival_i - T_propagation_i

These estimates have different uncertainties based on:
    - SNR (signal quality)
    - Propagation mode (1-hop vs multi-hop)
    - Discrimination confidence (shared frequencies)
    - Quality grade from convergence model

WEIGHTED FUSION:
    D_clock_fused = Σ(w_i × D_clock_i) / Σ(w_i)

Where weights w_i are computed from:
    w_i = confidence × grade_weight × mode_weight × snr_factor

GRADE WEIGHTS:    A: 1.0, B: 0.9, C: 0.7, D: 0.5     (see ``grade_scale``)
MODE WEIGHTS:     1E: 1.0, 1F: 0.95, 2F: 0.85, 3F: 0.7, GW: 1.0  (see ``mode_scale``)
(§3.4 Low: header tables were 2025-vintage and disagreed with the
current ``grade_scale`` / ``mode_scale`` literals in
``_calculate_weights`` -- reconciled 2026-05-20.)

================================================================================
AUTO-CALIBRATION
================================================================================
Each station has a systematic offset due to:
    - Matched filter group delay
    - Tone rise time differences
    - Detection threshold effects

CALIBRATION MODEL:
    calibration_offset_station = -mean(D_clock_station)

This brings each station's mean D_clock to 0, which is the UTC(NIST) target.

CALIBRATION UPDATE (Exponential Moving Average):
    offset_new = α × (-mean_current) + (1-α) × offset_old
    
Where α = max(0.5, 20/n_samples) for fast initial convergence.

CALIBRATION TARGET:
    All stations are calibrated to converge to 0 (UTC(NIST) alignment).
    No station serves as a reference for the others; the per-broadcast
    ``hardware_offset_ms`` is the only calibration arithmetic.

================================================================================
OUTLIER REJECTION
================================================================================
A single pre-fusion pass rejects outliers using the Median Absolute
Deviation (MAD) of the CALIBRATED residuals:

    MAD = median(|d_cal_i - median(d_cal)|) × 1.4826
    
Measurements deviating more than 3.5σ from the median are rejected.
Detection runs on calibrated residuals, not raw D_clock: raw values
carry 30-60 ms inter-broadcast offsets that would swamp the MAD.

This prevents ionospheric events or detection errors on one channel
from corrupting the fused estimate.

================================================================================
OUTPUT
================================================================================
The fusion produces:
    - d_clock_fused_ms: Calibrated weighted mean (should → 0)
    - d_clock_raw_ms: Uncalibrated mean (for comparison)
    - uncertainty_ms: Weighted standard deviation
    - n_broadcasts: Number of broadcasts contributing
    - quality_grade: A/B/C/D based on broadcast count and uncertainty

Output is written to: phase2/fusion/ (HDF5 L3 products)

================================================================================
USAGE
================================================================================
Continuous service mode (typical):

    python -m hf_timestd.core.multi_broadcast_fusion \\
        --data-root /data \\
        --interval 60

Programmatic usage:

    fusion = MultiBroadcastFusion(data_root=Path('/data'))
    result = fusion.fuse(lookback_minutes=10)
    print(f"Fused D_clock: {result.d_clock_fused_ms:+.3f} ms")

    Per-broadcast calibration offset learned from data.
    
    CALIBRATION vs PHYSICS SEPARATION (2026-02-06):
    -----------------------------------------------
    The total offset is decomposed into two components:
    
    1. hardware_offset_ms: CONSTANT systematic delays from the receiver chain.
       - Matched filter group delay (~0.4ms for 800ms template)
       - ADC/buffer alignment latency
       - Detection threshold bias
       These converge quickly and should NOT change once learned.
       Learning rate: Very slow after convergence (α_hw → 0.01).
    
    2. The RESIDUAL (D_clock - hardware_offset) is the SCIENCE PRODUCT:
       - Real ionospheric variations from climatology
       - Propagation model errors (which should be fixed in the model)
       - Measurement noise
       
    The old approach (offset_ms = -mean(D_clock)) absorbed EVERYTHING,
    hiding physics model errors. The new approach only calibrates hardware.
    
    Issue 3.2 Fix: Calibration is now per-broadcast (station+frequency) rather
    than per-station. This accounts for frequency-dependent ionospheric delays:
    - Different frequencies have different ionospheric delays (1/f²)
    - Same-frequency broadcasts share ionospheric conditions (correlated errors)
    
    BPM Note: BPM calibration must account for UT1/UTC alternation.
    UT1 minutes (25-29, 55-59) are excluded from calibration unless

        - Matched filter group delay (~1-2ms)
        - Propagation model errors (station-specific)

        - Kalman filter state (drift rate) - GPSDO doesn't drift
        
        What SHOULD persist:
        - Broadcast calibration offsets - these are real systematic delays
        
        The previous "always bootstrap from zero" approach was incorrect because

# ── Task 17c: the sign contradiction, stated and not acted on ────────
#
# AC0G-ND, 2026-09-07: the anchor-direct FUSE feed engaged at 20:41Z and
# 21:21Z and both times called the host clock SLOW (+23..28 ms, then
# +60.5 ms) while four NTP witnesses called it FAST (+13, +30 ms).  chrony
# followed FUSE and slewed the host the wrong way.  Which of the two is
# right is not known, and the closure cannot settle it: it moves every
# surface onto one plane at once, so nothing is left to disagree.
#
# Fusion therefore states the three numbers side by side once a minute,
# at INFO, whether or not the closure is on.
#
# ⛔ ONE convention, printed in the line itself: reference − system,
# POSITIVE MEANING THE HOST IS SLOW.  Every term is converted into it at
# the point where the name of the quantity changes, and nowhere else.
# The three sources disagree natively and each has to be turned around:
#
#     anchor    LabelPlaneAnchorSample.offset_s  reference − system  as-is
#     NTP pool  chronyc -c sources field 7       system − reference  NEGATE
#     d_clock   FusedResult.d_clock_fused_ms     system − reference  NEGATE
#
# Review C1/C2: the first version of this line asserted that chrony's
# field and its own third term already ran reference − system.  Neither
# does.  Fed the AC0G-ND 21:21Z episode -- anchor +60.5 ms slow, pool
# 30 ms fast -- it printed two POSITIVE numbers and would have read the
# contradiction as agreement, arguing for the closure on the evidence
# that condemned it.

# How often the line is written, seconds.  The fusion cycle is 60 s by
# default, so this is one line per cycle; the limiter exists for a
# station running a shorter interval.

    Every parameter is named for the convention it ARRIVES in, and the
    line prints ``reference − system`` throughout, positive meaning the
    host clock is SLOW.  Two of the three therefore get negated here.

    ``anchor_reference_minus_system_ms`` — the anchor's own
    ``LabelPlaneAnchorSample.offset_s``, already in the printed
    convention.

    ``pool_median_system_minus_reference_ms`` — the NTP consensus from
    ``chrony_stats.pool_median_system_minus_reference_ms``, in chrony's
    convention ("positive offsets indicate that the local clock is ahead
    of the source"), so NEGATED to print.  The contradiction is then
    visible as opposite signs: the ND 21:21Z episode prints anchor
    ``+60.5 ms`` beside NTP ``-30.0 ms``.

    ``d_clock_fused_ms`` — fusion's own ``system − reference`` against the
    RING plane (``reference_time_l2 = system_time − d_clock/1000``, and
    ``timing_error = arrival − prop_delay`` grows positive when the host
    stamps a tick late), so it too is negated.

    The third term printed is ``ring − registration``.  Writing
    ``d = d_clock`` and ``a = anchor``, with ``sys`` the host clock and
    ``ring``/``reg`` the two references::

        d = sys − ring          a = reg − sys
        d + a = reg − ring      →   ring − reg = −(d + a)

    The host cancels in the SUM, which is why the printed term is
    ``-(d_clock + anchor)``.  Review C2: this was written
    ``d_clock − anchor``, which expands to ``2·sys − ring − reg`` and
    double-counts the very clock it was meant to cancel.  So the check
    that matters: a station whose ring plane and registration agree
    prints ``+0.0 ms`` here however far the host has walked.
