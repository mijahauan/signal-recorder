"""The station's chain record: its plane and its budget.

TIMING_PROVENANCE_MODEL §3.2 gives the payload-anchored budget as it stands
and, since 2026-09-04, the sysclock chain.  Both ship as defaults so every
station publishes a chain; `[timing.provenance]` lets a station replace the
terms it has measured — the antenna-to-injector run, the GNSS feed — and
qualify its traceability claim in its own words.  MEASUREMENT_MODEL §9
invariant 4: a term may not leave the budget because it grew small.
