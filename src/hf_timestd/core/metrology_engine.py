Metrology Engine: Pure DSP Time-of-Arrival Measurement
======================================================
Part of the "Metrology First, Physics Second" architecture.

Responsibility:
1. "The Instrument": Measure what happened (Timestamp, Frequency, Power).
2. "The Facts": Report Raw Time of Arrival (TOA).
3. "No Interpretation": Do NOT attempt to calculate d_clock or propagation delay.
   (Except for basic speed-of-light sanity checks).

Inputs:
- Raw IQ buffer (complex64)
- System Time
- RTP Timestamp

Outputs:
- List[L1MetrologyMeasurement]

        Each peak represents a distinct propagation path (e.g. 2F2, 3F2, 4F2
        arriving at different delays).  Peaks are separated by at least
        ``mainlobe_samples`` so a single arrival's autocorrelation lobe is
        not re-detected as multiple peaks.

                               region around each found peak.  Defaults to
                               ``n_template // 2`` — the half-amplitude
                               width of the autocorrelation main lobe for
                               a windowed sinusoidal template (M-M8).

                               multipath fundamentally requires CLEAN
