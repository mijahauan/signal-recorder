GRAPE Signal Recorder - WWV/CHU timing signal recorder for HamSCI

Specialized system for recording time-standard radio signals from ka9q-radio
and uploading to the HamSCI PSWS repository.

Features:
- Direct RTP packet reception (no external tools)
- scipy-based decimation (16 kHz â†’ 10 Hz IQ)
- Digital RF format with HamSCI metadata
- Real-time quality monitoring (completeness, timing drift, packet loss)
- Web-based configuration and monitoring

See ARCHITECTURE.md for design details.
