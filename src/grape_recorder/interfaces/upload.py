    Interface for Function 6: Repository Upload
    
    Manages upload of Digital RF files to remote repository.
    Handles queuing, retry logic, bandwidth limiting, and status tracking.
    
    Design principle:
        Producer (Function 5) doesn't care about SSH, rsync, bandwidth limits,
        or retry logic. Just queues files and monitors status.
        
    Key features:
    - Persistent queue (survives restarts)
    - Automatic retry on failure
    - Bandwidth limiting
    - Progress tracking
    - Priority support
