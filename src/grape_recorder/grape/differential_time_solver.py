Differential Time Solver - Clock-Error-Immune UTC(NIST) Back-Calculation

This module implements the CORRECT approach to HF time transfer by using
DIFFERENTIAL measurements between WWV and WWVH that cancel out local clock error.

The Key Insight:
----------------
For a single receiver observing both WWV and WWVH simultaneously:

    timing_error_wwv  = T_prop_wwv  + clock_error
    timing_error_wwvh = T_prop_wwvh + clock_error

Subtracting:
    Δ_observed = timing_error_wwv - timing_error_wwvh
               = T_prop_wwv - T_prop_wwvh   ← Clock error CANCELS!

This differential is IMMUNE to local clock error and can be computed purely
from RTP sample positions (no UTC mapping required).

Mode Identification Strategy:
----------------------------
1. Calculate expected differential for each (mode_wwv, mode_wwvh) pair
2. Match Δ_observed to expected differentials
3. Select mode pair with best match
4. Use identified modes to compute individual T_prop values
5. Derive clock_error = timing_error_wwv - T_prop_wwv (or equivalently from WWVH)
6. This clock_error IS the UTC(NIST) offset we seek!

Inter-Frequency Consistency:
----------------------------
Different frequencies may use different modes, but:
- All should yield the SAME clock_error
- If they don't, we can detect mode misidentification
- Weighted average with outlier rejection gives robust estimate

CHU Support:
-----------
CHU (Ottawa, 3330/7850/14670 kHz) is included for:
- Single-station mode identification
- WWV-CHU or WWVH-CHU differential (cross-frequency)

Global Multi-Channel Solving:
----------------------------
With N detections from any stations/frequencies, we have N*(N-1)/2 differential
pairs. ALL pairs must be consistent with the SAME clock_error. This over-constrains
the problem and enables robust mode identification.

Example with 4 WWV frequencies + 3 CHU frequencies = 7 detections → 21 pairs!

Usage:
------
    solver = DifferentialTimeSolver(receiver_lat=39.0, receiver_lon=-94.5)
    
    result = solver.solve_differential(
        wwv_arrival_rtp=12345000,
        wwvh_arrival_rtp=12346000,
